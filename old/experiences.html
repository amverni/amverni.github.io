                                web development concepts such as server and
                                client-side dynamic pages, web security, and
                                MapReduce. A new focus this semester will be on
                                using cloud computing technologies such as AWS
                                for scaling up web applications. On top of the

                            <p>
                                I interned at Amazon for the summer of 2020
                                working on the Offer Listing Service team within
                                the eCommerce Foundation group. I was tasked
                                with building an audit tool to track historical
                                data to allow my team's customers to easily
                                query and visualize changes to that data. To
                                implement my solution, I used AWS cloud
                                computing technologies in order to handle large
                                volumes of incoming traffic (the tool is
                                currently handling over 500 transactions per
                                second). I was able to enable continuous
                                deployment of the tool by leveraging industry
                                leading DevOps practices. This project was
                                densley packed with learning opportunities.
                                After the design phase, I presented multiple
                                options along with my proposed design which I
                                had settled on after multiple discussions with
                                my teammates. This design meeting was a big
                                wake-up call for me. Over the first few weeks of
                                my internship I spent a lot of time fully
                                understanding the problem I was trying to solve,
                                however I failed to fully view the problem from
                                the perspective of my customers which was a
                                point drilled home at my design review. Moving
                                forward, I had multiple meetings with my
                                customers throughout the remainder of my
                                internship which proved vital for building a
                                product that they wanted to use. On the more
                                technical side of things I learned many new
                                skills involved in writing enterprise level
                                software such as injection and mocking for unit
                                testing.

                                outdoor smartwatches. The focus of my internship
                                was developing graphical representations of

                                outdoor and fitness smartwatches. In other
                                words, I created data fields that included

                                during activities. Another feature that I worked
                                on was implementing stealth mode on the Instinct
                                Tactical. This feature hides GPS data from
                                external use in order to comply with military
                                regulations while still allowing all on-device
                                features to remain functional.

                                For my first internship I worked at Garmin
                                International in the Automotive OEM department
                                as a software engineer intern during the summer
                                of 2018. I was on the navigation app UI team and
                                I primarily worked on building developer tools
                                to increase productivity. My first major project
                                was to create a tool to automatically download
                                all libraries necessary for debugging off of an
                                automotive head unit after a software crash.
                                This effectively eliminated a 15 minute manual
                                step from the debugging proces. Next, I worked
                                on automatically creating log files when
                                developers inserted a flashdrive into the head
                                unit in order to record any problems that
                                occured in field testing. My largest project was
                                to develop an automated testing framework to
                                simulate interactions between Garmin's
                                navigation app and the rest of the head unit. I
                                also implemented multiple customer facing
                                features such as providing screenshot previews
                                of map locations.

                                My most recent project was using machine
                                learning for conversation disentanglement which
                                is the separation of distinct conversations that
                                have occurred in the same thread over the same
                                period of time.

                                had already proven this to be possible with high
                                accuracy however it took 255 hours of human
                                effort to annotate the dataset and the
                                evaluation was done on conversation within the
                                same domain as the training data. Our goal was
                                to learn if it was possible to obtain a similar
                                accuracy in new domains with minimal human
                                effort. We proposed using transfer learning to
                                leverage the original dataset and then training
                                the model on a small set of data in the new
                                domain. We aimed to require users to spend on
                                the order of one hour or less annotating data in
                                a new domain in order to achieve high accuracy
                                conversation disentanglement in that new domain.
                                In order to so, we theorized that choosing the
                                right data to annotate was critical (e.g. a
                                single untangled conversation will likely not be
                                as informative as a heavily entangled
                                conversation). While it made sense that training
                                on more entangled data was likely better, there
                                was a number of problems with proving this that
                                I solved.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                First, I had to collect data large amounts of
                                data about IRC channels. The primary reason for
                                identifying channels in new domains and
                                collecting logs from these channels. I also used
                                this data to characterize the IRC space. For
                                example I determined the proportion of channels
                                that had logs (even if they weren't accessible)
                                as we felt that if channel admins cared enough
                                to keep around logs, disentangling those logs
                                would be of interest to them. This was one way
                                we motivated our research.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Second, there existed no metric for comparing
                                the level of entanglement of threads. Thus, I
                                conceptualized two metrics to do this - the
                                average number of conversations at a time
                                instant in a thread and the link intersection
                                ratio of a thread. If we annotate a
                                conversation, we create "links" from a message
                                to the message that it is in response to. A link
                                intersection occurs whenever two links span
                                messages in the same time range (thus indicating
                                that two conversations were occuring at
                                overlapping times). While these metrics matched
                                our intuition for what constitutes and more
                                entangled conversation, I still had to prove
                                their effectiveness. Thus, I used the strong
                                correlation between these metrics and other
                                metrics that we would expect to be affected by
                                the entanglement of a thread (e.g. number of
                                messages per minute, number of username
                                references in messages, etc.) to motivate the
                                usefullness of my custom metrics.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lastly, now that I had these metrics, I was able
                                to tackle our next problem which was proving
                                that we could use them to determine which
                                portions of conversations users should annotate
                                and later train the model on to most effectively
                                increase the accuracy of the model in the new
                                domain. There were a number of elements to this.
                                One was showing a strong correlation between the
                                calculated entanglement of a thread with the
                                original model (only transfer learning) and the
                                trained model (transfer learning plus training
                                in the new domain) because it would be
                                counterproductive to annotate all the data to
                                find the most entangled data to annotate only
                                that data. Another important aspect was running
                                experiments to determine the effectiveness of
                                training on different amounts of data and
                                various levels of entangled data. We will use
                                these results to guide our suggestion for
                                choosing data to annotate for new users in new
                                domains.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Previously I also did research in the space of
                                image annotation tools where I worked on two
                                main projects. First, I worked on an image
                                annotation tool that aggragated crowd worker's
                                responses for a particle filtering task to
                                reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D images
                                particularly geared towards images of vehicles.
                                This would allow us to train autonomous vehicles
                                using already existing videos from the
                                perspective of a car driving on the road rather
                                than needing to go collect that data manually.
                                This is particularly interesting because we can
                                use videos of accidents (or "close calls") to
                                train autonomous vehicles rather putting cars
                                into this situation purposefully in order to
                                collect that data. My work on this project
                                primarily involved making improvements to the UI
                                so that it was easier to use for our target
                                audience - crowd workers. Initial testing with
                                expert annotators showed that our improvements
                                led to a 30% increase in accuracy.

                                The second project focused on the generalization
                                of image annotation tools. We decided to look
                                into what made image annotation tasks difficult
                                and we found that there were two main types of
                                challenges: challenges caused by the properties
                                of the image (e.g. low color contrast) being
                                annotated and challenges caused by the goal of
                                the annotation task (e.g. boundary
                                identification). This led to us developing the
                                concepts of image property categories and task
                                requirement categories that are found across
                                domains of image annotation tasks. From these
                                categories, we developed a test harness which
                                should guide the design of image annotation
                                tools and testbeds that wish to generalize
                                across a range of domains. This work was
                                published and presented at UIST 2019 and the

                                When I joined the
                                <a href="https://mrover.org"
                                    >Michigan Mars Rover Team (MRover)</a
                                >, I was first beginning my career as a computer
                                scientist. Over the past three and a half years
                                I have grown both technically and personally
                                through contributing to the development of the
                                rover's codebase. A large part of my learning
                                came through the mentorship of more senior
                                members on the team. Now I am one of the most
                                seniored members on the team and I have loved
                                being able to give back to the team by passing
                                on my knowledge to younger members. I am doing
                                this through both providing one-on-one mentoring
                                to students and by presenting technical material
                                to the team. I am also tasked with providing
                                feedback at design reviews and advising the new
                                team leadership based on my past experiences on
                                the team.

                                Another key responsibility of being a technical
                                advisor looking at improving the team from a big
                                picture perspective. Instead of being primarily
                                concerned with making sure our team scored as
                                high as possible at the current year’s
                                competition, I am focused on the long term
                                growth and success of the team. Some ways I am
                                doing this is helping restructure the team where
                                necessary as we grow, aiding the team in
                                pursuing technical and non-technical projects
                                that will allow us to become more sophisticated
                                and fight stagnation, and increasing member
                                retention. One example is that I introduced new
                                project management strategies into our workflow.
                                We use GitHub to manage our codebase which has
                                many built in features for managing projects
                                such as issue tracking. Thus, it was a natural
                                transition to start using these features with
                                our existing projects. I first prototyped my
                                proposed workflow with a project I was working
                                on to get a proof of concept and then helped the
                                software leads start using them for their
                                projects. This has improved our ability to track
                                the progress of our work and delegate tasks to
                                members. This has also facilitated our
                                transition to remote work during the pandemic.

                                I was named the lead of the Autonomous
                                Navigation subteam for my second season on the

                                >. My primary responsibility was the successful
                                design and implementation of the autonomous
                                navigation system. I had to ensure that we were
                                meeting all of our design requirements set by
                                our systems engineering team and that the
                                implementation of those designs would be
                                completed within our allocated budget and met
                                all of the critical deadlines set by our
                                executive board. All of these things were tasks
                                I was capable of performing for myself, however
                                I was no longer just taking care of myself. I
                                was now managing a team of 17 undergraduate
                                students with varying programming backgrounds
                                that I had to plan for and delegate work to.
                                Initially I thought that I was going to be able
                                to excel in this role because I was an expert in
                                the subject matter for our subteam. This was far
                                from true. My first semester as lead, I
                                struggled greatly to bring out the best in my
                                members due to a steep learning curve in our
                                teams tools, a lack of experience on my part in
                                properly delegating tasks, and wavering
                                commitment from some members. Our team’s
                                progress was minimal and I was running out of
                                ideas on how to change that. Two months into the
                                season I reached out to one of the seniors on
                                our team for his advice. After a lot of
                                discussion we realized that members were
                                treating my meetings like they were a class
                                lecture. We concluded that I was likely hurting
                                the team by trying to provide so much help. By
                                slowing down and focusing on group efforts to
                                try to make sure everyone could contribute, I
                                wasn’t allowing some members to reach their full
                                potential. At this point I switched to forcing
                                more independence by members. Through pushing my
                                members to work outside of their comfort zones
                                and take on larger roles and responsibilities, I
                                improved their confidence. This increased not
                                only the overall productivity of our team, but
                                also allowed each member to contribute more than
                                they believed they were capable of.

                                As one of the leads most heavily involved in the
                                preparation for the autonomy task at
                                competition, I was placed in charge of making
                                decision during that 40 minute timed task. I was
                                in charge of planning our strategy and making
                                high pressure decisions that highly impacted our
                                team’s performance. Ultimately, our team placed
                                third in the autonomy task and produced our best
                                score in team history. Throughout the
                                competition I attempted to convince my entire
                                team that we were going to get a perfect score.
                                Many of my teammates begrudgingly followed my
                                lead but never truly believed it. Despite
                                missing this goal I had set for us, by the end
                                of competition I had proven to my team that we
                                were competing for the top spot in the autonomy
                                task. Further, I instilled the belief in them
                                that our system is perennial contender to win
                                the University Rover Challenge - a feat no one
                                thought we could achieve days earlier.

                                dream come true. I played club roller hockey at

                                across various disciplines at the University of

                                every summer. I joined MRover in the fall of
                                2017 during my sophomore year and have been
                                working with the team in various roles ever
                                since.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In my first year, I joined the Autonomous
                                Navigation subteam where I, along with two other
                                members, was tasked with developing the service
                                that executed all navigation logic for the
                                autonomous mode of the rover. The main goal was
                                to develop code to autonomously drive our rover
                                between marked waypoints avoiding any obstacles
                                in our path given GPS coordinates that were up
                                to 10 meters away from the waypoints. Under our
                                implementation, once at the GPS coordinate we
                                would perform a search for the waypoint marker.
                                This was an extremely challenging project for us
                                as neither my teammates nor I had ever worked on
                                components in such a large project before. As we
                                were approaching the end of my first season on
                                the team, we had made a ton of progress however
                                the complexity of our project had grown so much
                                that anytime we went to add features, we would
                                spend twice as long debugging and fixing what
                                broke by adding the feature. After a while of
                                this, I sat down with our chief software
                                engineer to discuss how we could better approach
                                the problem to avoid this issue. We decided that
                                using a finite state machine would be a better
                                implementation as it would allow us to model our
                                infinitely complex task as a finite set of
                                states. This gave us the ability to track our
                                state transitions at every instant which allowed
                                us to more quickly identify the set of inputs
                                that was causing unintended behavior in our
                                code. While this refactor was likely best for
                                the long term, it was a large undertaking and we
                                were quickly approaching a critical deadline.
                                Knowing how inefficiently we were currently
                                working, I decided to take on more
                                responsibility and perform the refactor myself.
                                After completing this, I gained a strong sense
                                of ownership of the navigation service and
                                quickly became the expert on the subject within
                                our team. A few weeks later I earned one of the
                                greatest feelings of accomplishment I’ve ever
                                felt when I clicked the “on” button and saw the
                                rover successfully turn and drive to a GPS
                                waypoint in the back parking lot of our machine
                                shop.

                                In large part because of my initiative here and
                                my drive to keep pushing the team to build a
                                better autonomy system, I was named the
                                Autonomous Navigation Lead for the following
                                season and earned myself an invitation to come
                                to competition. Competition gave us some key
                                insights to focus on for the next season. While
                                autonomy mode worked extremely well in our
                                custom built simulator, the integration with the
                                computer vision system and odometry sensors
                                limited our performance. Thus, I turned our
                                focus for the following year to improving the
                                robustness of the system in the real world
                                despite having imperfect inputs. This led to
                                three major improvements to the autonomous
                                navigation system in my second year on the team.
                                First, we improved our navigation algorithms. We
                                gutted our search algorithm and redesigned it to
                                work in a way that handled false-positive
                                without discarding previous work done, and
                                reduced false-negatives, by adding strategic
                                pauses. These pauses made an incredible
                                difference because, by sitting motionless for a
                                few seconds, we gave our computer vision service
                                a chance to view our surroundings while the
                                rover was still (and thus the camera was
                                stabilized). While this was a simple feature to
                                add, it was not easy to determine it was
                                necessary because we did not do enough testing
                                outside of our simulator that first season. The
                                second improvement we made was to increase the
                                accuracy of our odometry data. To achieve this,
                                I designed a sensor fusion algorithm to
                                calculate location and heading estimates. The
                                algorithm calculated multiple estimates and
                                weigh them based on our confidence in the
                                sensors used for each estimate. For example,
                                instead of relying on just our IMU to calculate
                                current heading, we obtained a second estimate
                                through our GPS and accelerometer. We used the
                                GPS’s track angle to determine the absolute
                                heading while we were driving and we found the
                                change in heading while we were turning using
                                the accelerometer. By relying on more sensors,
                                we became less likely to have inaccurate results
                                in theory and this proved to be true in our
                                testing. This also mitigated the risk of a
                                sensor failing as we could detect a sensor
                                failure and set the weight of the estimate(s)
                                based on that sensor to zero. The third
                                improvement was to decrease our reliance on a
                                single computer vision sensor for obstacle
                                detection. I initiated our team’s research into
                                ultrasonic and time of flight sensors which
                                could be used alongside our stereoscopic camera.
                                Since these were cheaper sensors than a
                                stereoscopic camera, it also opened the door for
                                using multiple of them in different positions.
                                This aided in detecting steep drop-offs that we
                                wanted the rover to avoid. After initial
                                research I transitioned this project to some
                                younger members.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These efforts proved to be well worth it as our
                                team performed very well this year at
                                competition achieving third place in the
                                autonomy task, our best finish in team history.

                                Navigation Lead from a less technical
                                perspective can be found in the Autonomous
                                Navigation Lead section.

                                My third year on the team I transitioned to
                                being the lead software technical advisor.
                                Details about my role in this position from a
                                less technical perspective can be found in the
                                Software Technical Advisor section. This
                                position also came with many technical
                                challenges as well. First, I had to learn more
                                about the infrastructure of our software system
                                so that I could help maintain it. For example we
                                use a custom build tool that manages
                                dependencies that I add features to as the
                                team’s needs change. Another technical project
                                that I’ve worked on in this role is building the
                                second version of the autonomous navigation
                                simulator web application (pictured<span
                                    class="mobile-only"
                                    >above</span
                                ><span class="desktop-only">to the right</span
                                >). The largest problem with our original
                                simulator was that it had a very large learning
                                curve and therefore to most people on the team
                                it was a black box that people were afraid to
                                touch. So I refactored it using a modern web
                                framework, Vue. I also used TypeScript and
                                ESLint in order to reduce the risk of members
                                new to web development from making some of the
                                common mistakes of JavaScript. This refactor
                                also allowed me to more easily add new features
                                to the simulator such as adding noise to our
                                simulated sensors.

                                In the winter semester of 2019, I took
                                Conversational Artificial Intelligence as my
                                senior design class. Working with
                                <a href="https://clinc.com">Clinc</a> and a
                                small group of students, I built
                                <a
                                    href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fH7zBtLAE_brbpPvGrfjnIudYgc8P53vFjYzqvAg0LI/edit?usp=sharing"

                                >
                                which is a virtual assistant to tutor students
                                in basic mathematics (primarily the four basic
                                operators). Mia's capabilities include giving
                                concept explanations, providing example problems
                                with solutions, providing practice problems,
                                checking the correctness of answers, and walking
                                students through the solutions of problems.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Within this project I focused on three main
                                tasks. First, I created the UI for the project
                                which was a simple client-side dynamic web page.
                                The page had a chatbot-style compoent for users
                                to input (via speech or text) queries and a
                                "chalkboard" for displaying math problems.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Second, I designed the state machine that the
                                Clinc platform uses to model conversations. This
                                defined how conversations would flow by defining
                                acceptable responses at each point in a
                                conversation and defining how types of responses
                                would transition users from one conversation
                                state to another.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lastly, I performed the data curation needed for
                                training Clinc's machine learning models. I
                                collected sample queries, classified the query
                                by the type of question (e.g. concept
                                explanation request, example problem request,
                                etc.), and labelled the correct data extraction
                                from the query (e.g. extracting the concept from
                                a concept explanation request). This had to be
                                done for thousands of data points so I utilized
                                crowdsourcing via
