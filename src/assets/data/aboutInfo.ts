  bio: "Hi! My name is Andrew and I am a software engineer at Microsoft working on the Azure Privileged Identity Management team. I graduated from the University of Michigan in December 2020 with a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My career goal is to use my passions to positively impact the lives of others while challenging myself to continually become a better version of myself. My professional interests lie in user experiences, autonomous robotics, and algorithms. With my current personal projects, I am exploring mobile applications, automated testing, and refactoring this website into React. I have experience with user interfaces, RESTful APIs, and object oriented programming. In my free time I love nearly anything sports related and do my best to stay active. My favorite sports to follow are hockey and football, especially the Michigan Wolverines. Go blue! I also enjoy working on DIY projects and playing sub-par golf."
